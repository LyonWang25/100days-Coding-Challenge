## My process

I believe it is kinda easy so I did't think a lot. I just build step by step.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I found that how to make a banner on the img. The purple mask is like a filter. Initally, I want to add filter code in css, but it didnt work. Even I add like filter: blur(10px). The img still displayed a normal img.
I tried to find the reason or the mistakes. However, I still couldn't find it.
