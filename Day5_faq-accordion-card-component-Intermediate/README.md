## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge is so diffcult that I can solve the img position.
finally I used a old school way to adjust the position such as "top: 50px, left:50px, etc". I knew it not a good way to set position like that. I try to use flex to do that, but it didn't work.

### Continued development

Still learning React courses.
