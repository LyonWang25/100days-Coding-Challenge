## My process

First build a item and use same css with the rest of 2 items(boxes).
Use flex to layout include mobile version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Compare to day2 and day3 challenge, I only complete this challenge in 30minutes.
I think css code is more organized than previous days challenge.
