# 100 Daily Challenge - still continueðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„


## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Most of my codeing challenges base on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) design.

Try to help improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

**In this repositories, I used various language such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and other framwork like Bootstrap 5, jQuery, and React.js**
**For the Large challenge (complex website), I will add a new repositories to make you easily to know what I did.(Please go to main repositories page)

## The challenge

Sometime I was busy on my shcool projects and assignments, so probably I won't update everyday, but I will do my best to achieve 100 days!!!

CHEAR!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

Design brands us.
Coding makes existence.
